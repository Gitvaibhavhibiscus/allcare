               <p>Treating asthma typically involves a combination of medication and lifestyle adjustments tailored to the individual's needs. The treatment approach may vary depending on factors such as the type of asthma, the patient's age, and specific triggers. Here are the main categories of asthma treatment:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li><span>Breathing Exercises: </span> Techniques such as deep breathing exercises and pulmonary rehabilitation programs can help improve lung function and manage asthma symptoms.</li>
                  <li><span>Quick-Acting Treatments:</span> These medications, such as short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol), provide rapid relief during asthma attacks or when symptoms flare up suddenly.</li>
                  <li><span>Long-Term Asthma Control Medications:</span> These medications, including inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting bronchodilators, leukotriene modifiers, and biologic therapies, are used regularly to prevent asthma symptoms and reduce the frequency and severity of attacks over time.</li>
