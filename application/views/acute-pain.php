               <h3>Did you know?</h3>
               <p>Acute pain serves as a protective mechanism, alerting the body to potential tissue damage or injury. Research published in the journal Pain Management Nursing highlights the evolutionary importance of acute pain in promoting survival by prompting individuals to avoid harmful stimuli and seek necessary medical attention.</p>

               <p class="mb-3">Acute pain, like a fleeting visitor, can range from a mild twinge to a severe throb. Thankfully, it typically bids farewell within six months, often vanishing once its underlying cause is addressed.</p>
               <h3 class="mb-3">What is Chronic Pain then? And how is it different from Acute pain?</h3>
               <p class="mb-0">While acute pain usually fades with healing, chronic pain can linger long after the injury has mended. It's like a stubborn guest overstaying its welcome, with pain signals continuing to buzz in your nervous system for weeks, months, or even years.This persistent pain isn't just a nuisance; it can lead to tense muscles, restricted movement, fatigue, and even changes in appetite. Interestingly, sometimes chronic pain arises without a clear cause or understanding.</p>
