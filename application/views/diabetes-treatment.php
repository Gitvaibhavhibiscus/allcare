               <p>Diabetes is a global epidemic, with an estimated 463 million adults living with the condition worldwide. According to research published in The Lancet, the prevalence of diabetes has more than doubled over the past four decades, making it one of the most significant public health challenges of the 21st century.</p>

               <p class="mb-3">Diabetes, or diabetes mellitus, is a group of metabolic diseases where a person has high blood sugar. This happens either because the pancreas doesn't make enough insulin or because the cells don't respond properly to the insulin it produces. There are three main types: type 1, type 2, and gestational.</p>
               <p class="mb-3">Normally, our bodies turn sugars and carbs into glucose, which fuels our cells. But for people with diabetes, it's a bit different. Their bodies don't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin properly.</p>
               <p class="mb-3">The result? Glucose piles up in the bloodstream because the cells can't take it in. High glucose levels can harm tiny blood vessels in the kidney, heart, eyes, and nerves, leading to issues like heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, blindness, and nerve damage.</p>
