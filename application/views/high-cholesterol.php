               <p>High cholesterol is a significant risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 93 million adults in the United States aged 20 or older have total cholesterol levels higher than 200 mg/dL, which is considered borderline high risk. Of these, about 29 million adults have total cholesterol levels higher than 240 mg/dL, placing them at significantly higher risk for heart disease.</p>

                  <p class="mb-0">Cholesterol serves as a crucial building block in the body, being a type of lipid essential for various functions. Produced naturally by the liver, cholesterol plays a pivotal role in forming cell membranes, synthesising certain hormones, and aiding in the production of vitamin D. However, due to its inability to dissolve in water, cholesterol requires transportation through the bloodstream with the assistance of lipoproteins, which are produced by the liver.</p>

                  <li><span>Total cholesterol level: </span>Typically, a level below 200 mg/dL is considered optimal, although the balance between HDL and LDL levels is also crucial.</li>
                  <li><span>LDL cholesterol levels: </span>For most individuals, keeping LDL levels below 130 mg/dL is recommended, although this target may vary depending on individual risk factors.</li>
                  <li><span>HDL cholesterol levels: </span>Higher levels of HDL, ideally 60 mg/dL or above, are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease.</li>
                  <li><span>Triglycerides: </span>Levels below 150 mg/dL are considered optimal for reducing the risk of heart disease.</li>

                  <h3 class="mb-3">Causes for High Cholesterol:</h3>
                  <p>Several factors can contribute to elevated levels of bad cholesterol:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li><span>Poor diet: </span> Consuming foods high in saturated fats (found in animal products) and trans fats (found in processed snacks and baked goods) can increase cholesterol levels. Foods rich in cholesterol, such as red meat and full-fat dairy products, also contribute to elevated cholesterol levels.</li>
                     <li><span>Obesity: </span>  Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher are at greater risk of high cholesterol.</li>
                     <li><span>Lack of exercise: </span> Regular physical activity helps raise HDL ("good") cholesterol levels and modifies the composition of LDL ("bad") cholesterol particles, making them less harmful.</li>
					 <li><span>Smoking: </span> Cigarette smoking damages blood vessel walls, making them more susceptible to fatty deposits. Smoking can also lower HDL cholesterol levels.</li>
                     <li><span>Age: </span>  As individuals age, changes in body chemistry may lead to an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, the liver may become less efficient at removing LDL cholesterol with age.</li>
                     <li><span>Diabetes: </span> High blood sugar levels associated with diabetes contribute to elevated levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and lower levels of HDL cholesterol. High blood sugar also damages arterial linings, exacerbating cholesterol-related issues.</li>
