            <p>Melissa is a Licensed Mental Health Therapist. She completed her undergraduate work at 
            The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. and her graduate work at the University 
            of Florida. As a facilitator of the Love and Support component for All Care’s Intensive Cardiac
