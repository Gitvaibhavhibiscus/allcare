                  <p>Depression is defined as a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a person’s behavior, thoughts, feelings, and sense of well-being. It causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. </p>
                  <p class="mb-0">Depression is also called a major depressive disorder or clinical depression, and it affects how you feel, think, and behave. It can even lead to a variety of physical problems. It should be known that depression isn’t just having the “blues.” It isn’t a weakness and isn’t something that can just go away on its own.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-2">1. Major Depressive Disorder</h4>
                    <p class="mt-2">When someone experiences five or more symptoms of depression consistently for at least two weeks it is termed as Major depressive disorder. During these episodes, it's not uncommon for everyday activities like work, studying, eating, and sleeping to become incredibly challenging, if not impossible.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2">These episodes of major depression can vary in frequency and intensity. For some, they may only happen once or twice in a lifetime, while for others, they may recur frequently, casting a shadow over various stages of life.</p>
                    <div class="col-12 col-md card mt-4 m-0">
                        <p class="card_title text-left">Reasons behind these episodes can be:</p>
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>What's particularly challenging is that major depressive symptoms can arise in response to significant life events, such as the loss of a loved one, the end of a romantic relationship, or a serious medical illness. In some cases, these symptoms may even occur simultaneously with the event or develop shortly afterward, further complicating an already difficult situation.</p>

                            <p class="mt-2">Persistent depressive disorder, often referred to as PDD, presents a unique challenge. Unlike the intense, shorter episodes of major depressive disorder, <span style="font-weight:700;">PDD lingers for approximately two years or more.</span> While it's generally less severe than major depression, it encompasses the same array of symptoms.</p>

                                    <p>Individuals grappling with PDD may find themselves caught in a cycle of low energy, fluctuating appetite, and disrupted sleep patterns. Additionally, they may experience persistent stress, irritability, and a subtle inability to find joy in activities that once brought them pleasure. Though less acute than major depression, PDD's prolonged duration can still significantly impact one's quality of life.</p>

This fluctuation between intense emotional states can profoundly impact a person's life, creating a rollercoaster of experiences that range from euphoria to despair.</p>
