               <p>Obesity presents a significant health concern in the United States, with staggering numbers highlighting its prevalence and associated risks. Over 70 million adults in the U.S. grapple with obesity, evenly split between men and women. Additionally, 99 million adults are overweight, with a higher proportion among women.

                  <p class="mb-4">Obesity is characterised by an abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat in the body, which can have detrimental effects on one's health.</p>
				  <p class="mb-4">Several factors contribute to the development of obesity, including genetic predisposition, behavioural patterns, and hormonal influences. Essentially, obesity occurs when caloric intake exceeds caloric expenditure, leading to the storage of excess calories as fat.</p>

                  <p class="mb-4">Body mass index (BMI) serves as a straightforward measure of weight relative to height and is widely used to classify overweight and obesity among adults. It is calculated by dividing an individual's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in metres (kg/m2).</p>
				  <p class="mb-4">For adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) provides the following classifications based on BMI:</p>
				  <ul>
					<li><span>Overweight: </span>BMI greater than or equal to 25.</li>
					<li><span>Obesity: </span>BMI greater than or equal to 30</li>
				  </ul>
				  <p>These thresholds serve as guidelines for assessing weight status and identifying individuals at increased risk of associated health complications.</p>
