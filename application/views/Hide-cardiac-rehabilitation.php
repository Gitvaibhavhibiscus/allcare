					<h1>Cardiac Rehabilitation Program</h1>
					<p>Welcome to the All Care Medical Consultants Cardiac Rehabilitation program. We are so excited for you to start the program with us. As you begin this journey, we have created educational materials to support you on your way. Our program is preventative, which means you do not need to have multiple “qualifying diagnoses.” It also means that you may have graduated from a previous Cardiac rehabilitation program and no longer qualify traditionally. As a value-based internal medicine practice who believes in treating all aspects of “you,” our practice will provide you with education and support through the lens of lifestyle medicine. “Lifestyle medicine is a medical apporach that uses evidence-based behavioral interventions to prevent, treat and manage chronic disease.” – American College of Lifestyle Medicine.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5">What is Cardiac Rehabilitation?</h3>
					<p>Cardiac rehabilitation is a medically supervised program designed to improve your heart health after experiencing heart problems or treatments. It can take place at an outpatient clinic or in a hospital rehabilitation center. At All Care, your cardiac rehab team includes doctors, nurse practitioners, exercise physiologists, nutrition and weight management specialists, licensed mental health counselors, in addition to other medical and health care providers. Our goal is to help you make lifestyle choices to improve your heart health.</p>
