						<p class="text-sm-left">I have been going to All Care in Palm Harbour for about 5 years. The staff there has always been most helpful and understanding. They show by their actions that they care about their patients as human beings, not just another bank account to be milked. You too will find them very <span class="testi-bac">professional, kind, caring and courteous.</span> Special shoutout to Shannon, Kassie, Mina and Dr. Nobert Engleman, thank you so much for all you do.</p>

						<p class="text-sm-left">No matter which office you visit, the <span class="testi-bac">staff and administration of All Care Medical is superb!</span> Waiting time in the lobby is typically 5-10 minutes, they are very flexible in finding openings in case a visit is crucial, and try their best to work with every patient. I have been under the care of the doctors since June 2013 and they are they only physicians I have had over a 13 year period to be able to direct me to the proper specialists and provide treatment that no others have done for two sever</p>

						<p class="text-sm-left">I was so sick and I called today after a holiday weekend hoping they could fit me in. The front desk was so nice and fit me in at 9 am. The doctor saw me and was thorough with the exam. Answered all my questions. Assured me I'd be okay. When I left to check out, the woman was so sweet. Gave me my paperwork and made my next appointment. From start to finish, everything was so comforting. I am <span class="testi-bac">so happy to be at such a caring facility.</span></p>

The staff at the Largo office is friendly and helpful. I Appreciate that they have taken the extra time to assist with prescription challenges that have arisen from my conversion to Medicare.
