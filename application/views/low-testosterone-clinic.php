                <h2 class="mt-4">What is testosterone?</h2>
				<p>When boys hit puberty, Testosterone helps develop the male features like body, facial hair, deeper voice, and muscle strength.  It is the male sex hormone that is made in the testicles. Testosterone hormone levels are important to normal male sexual development and functions.</p>

                        <p>The testosterone level in men decreases with age, but some men experiecne it in their early age as well, this is called testosterone deficiency (TD) or often referred to as Low Testosterone (Low-T).</p>
                        <p>As per The American Urology Association (AUA), low blood testosterone (Low-T) as less than 300 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) on two tests obtained in the morning. Some of the symptoms or conditions may accompany TD:</p>

                        <ul class="pl-3">
                            <li>Low sex drive</li>
                            <li>Fatigue</li>
                            <li>Reduced lean muscle mass</li>
                            <li>Irritability</li>
                            <li>Erectile dysfunction</li>
                            <li>Depression</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Some other symptoms include opioid use, some congenital conditions (medical conditions you are born with), loss of or harm to the testicles, diabetes, and obesity (being overweight). </p>

                        <h2 class="mb-3">Treatment</h2>
                        <p>There are various lifestyle changes that can help in increasing your testosterone level. Adding some resistance exercise and losing weight are two changes that are very effective.</p>

                        <p>Resistance exercise like lifting weights is related to temporary increases in testosterone levels. This increase is typically much higher in younger men than older men and doesn’t appear to greatly increase the overall level of testosterone.</p>

                        <p>Most exercise, especially cardiovascular exercise, can contribute to the loss of excessive weight, which can help to increase levels of testosterone. This is particularly true for people who are obese.</p>
