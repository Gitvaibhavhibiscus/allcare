				<p>Are you looking for a better way to manage healthcare and have more time with your doctor? If you live in Pinellas County, see what we are all about. Our newly opened, state-of-the-art All Care Health Center was born out of the belief that healthcare providers must do a better job of treating the <b>whole</b> person.</p>

				Our location in Seminole houses a clinical team that works together to enhance a patient’s experience with quality and convenience. Patients are supervised by medical doctors who oversee both an in-house wellness regimen as well as diagnosing and treating illness and disease as needed.</p>

						<h2>What is Functional Medicine?</h2>
						<p class="pt-3 pb-3">A perfect blend of wellness and medicine is referred to as functional medicine, a practice that addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach between doctor and patient. In this way, we shift the traditional disease-centered focus to a more patient-centered approach.</p>

					<p>5 Basic principles that define Functional Medicine (Can be added as 4 columns)</p>
					<ul style="list-style: decimal; margin-bottom:30px;">
						<li>Each Individual is Different: Functional Medicine views each individual as being different; genetically and biochemically unique. The personalized health care focuses on treating the individual and not the disease. It focusses on the normal healing mechanisms of the body, naturally, rather than attacking disease directly.</li>
						<li>Science-Based: Research has shown that what happens in our body is connected in a complicated network or web of relationships. It is important to understand this relationship in order to get complete in-depth knowledge of the functioning of the body.</li>
						<li>Self Regulation and healing of Body: Our body has the capacity for self-regulation, which expresses itself through a dynamic balance of all your body systems. The body has the ability to heal and prevent disease related to aging. </li>
						<li>Keeping Health: Health is not just the absence of disease, but a state of immense vitality.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>At All Care Wellness, we offer a variety of treatments based on the fundamental concepts of regenerative and restorative medicine including nutrition, yoga and pilates classes, corrective exercise training for all levels and abilities, acupuncture, and more.</p>

					<p>Doctors spend more time with patients, listening to their histories, and looking at genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors that can influence long-term health and complex chronic diseases.</p>

					<p>We can not only help you feel better and prevent disease, we can do it with added convenience and a commitment to your total well being.</p>

					<p>Our goal is simple… healthy, happy patients free of chronic disease, living balanced lives with positive purpose. </p>
