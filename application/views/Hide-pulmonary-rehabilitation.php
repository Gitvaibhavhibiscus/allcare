					<h1>Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program</h1>
					<p>Welcome to the All Care Medical Consultants Pulmonary Rehabilitation program. We are so excited for you to start the program with us. As you begin this journey, we have created educational materials to support you on your way. Our program is preventative, which means you do not need to have multiple “qualifying diagnoses.” It also means that you may have graduated from a previous pulmonary rehabilitation program and no longer qualify traditionally. As a value-based internal medicine practice who believes in treating all aspects of “you,” our practice will provide you with education and support through the lens of lifestyle medicine. “Lifestyle medicine is a medical apporach that uses evidence-based behavioral interventions to prevent, treat and manage chronic disease.” – American College of Lifestyle Medicine.</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5">What is Pulmonary Rehabilitation?</h3>
					<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation is a supervised medical program that helps people who have lung diseases live and breathe better. A comprehensive program includes pa- tient assessment and individualized therapies that include, but are not limited to, exercise and breathing training, education, and behavior change. At All Care, your pulm rehab team includes doctors, nurse practitioners, exercise physiologists, nutri- tion and weight management specialists, licensed mental health counselors, in addi- tion to other medical and health care providers.
