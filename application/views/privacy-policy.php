Exceptions to these requirements may apply where the disclosure of Personal Information is necessary for All Care and/or ECW to coordinate with service providers or Your selected healthcare provider, carry out its employment law obligations, or for other reasons as permitted by the Supplemental Principles under the Privacy Shield Framework or applicable law.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Security of Personal Information:</h5>
					<p>All Care and/or ECW has reasonable and appropriate safeguards in place to help protect the Personal Information ECW collects from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Although All Care and/or ECW attempts to protect the Personal Information in our possession, no security system is perfect, and ECW cannot promise that Your Personal Information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation:</h5>
					<p>All Care and/or ECW limits the use of Personal Information to ways that are compatible and relevant to the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected or subsequently authorized or for which consent was obtained. All Care and/or ECW will take reasonable steps to ensure that Personal Information is reliable for its intended use, accurate, complete, and current.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Retention of Personal Information:</h5>
					<p>All Care and/or ECW will retain Your Personal Information as needed to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. All Care and/or ECW will retain and use Your Personal Information as necessary to comply with All Care and/or ECW’s business requirements, legal obligations, resolve disputes, protect our assets, and enforce our agreements.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Aggregated De-Identified Information:</h5>
					<p>All Care and/or ECW may provide aggregated information related to Your Personal Information to some of All Care and/or ECW’s business partners. This information is used in a collective manner and does not identify You individually in any way. In addition, as set forth in the Terms of Use and/or Terms and Conditions for the Services, All Care and/or ECW may, subject to the limitations set out in the Terms of Use or Terms and Conditions, use certain de-identified PHI.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Links to Third Party Websites:</h5>
					<p>The Site may contain certain links to third party websites. All Care and/or ECW is not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content found on these websites. You should check the privacy notice and policies of each website You visit. Links to third party sites are provided solely for Your convenience and any use or submission of data to such sites shall be at Your sole risk.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4 mb-2">Right to Access and Correct Personal Information:</h5>
					<p>All Care and/or ECW strives to make sure that our information is reliable, accurate, and up-to-date. While Personal Information is maintained by All Care and/or ECW, You may access the Personal Information that All Care and/or ECW has collected directly from You to the extent required by law to review, update, and correct inaccuracies. Upon request made to the contact listed below under the section titled “Contact Information,” All Care and/or ECW will provide You with reasonable access to the Personal Information All Care and/or ECW has collected from You. Because Personal information—for example, Your email address—is required to use the Site, we retain certain Personal Information as long as your account is active. You will have the opportunity to correct, transfer, update, modify, or delete this information by logging into Your account and updating Your Personal Information online or contacting All Care and/or ECW at the address listed below under the section titled “Contact Information.” You may also limit the use and disclosure of Your Personal Information by either unsubscribing from marketing communications or contacting All Care and/or ECW at the address listed below under the section titled “Contact Information.” Please note that some information may remain in All Care and/or ECW’s records even after You request deletion of Your Personal Information, to the extent permitted by the Privacy Shield Principles or required by applicable laws. Additionally, there may be limits to the amount of information All Care and/or ECW can practically provide. For example, we may limit access to Personal Information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to an individual’s privacy or where doing so would violate others’ rights.</p>

					<p>Regardless of the above, however, and except as required by applicable law, All Care and/or ECW does not provide You with access to patient records and will recommend that You directly contact Your healthcare provider to obtain a copy of Your patient records.</p>

					<p>Pursuant to applicable law, All Care and/or ECW may be required to send You notice of known or suspected security breaches that impact Your Personal Information. In the event that All Care and/or ECW must provide a notice of a security breach to You, All Care and/or ECW will send security breach notices to the contact information contained in Your account information unless All Care and/or ECW is required by law to notify You using another method. Otherwise, if All Care and/or ECW needs, or is required, to contact You concerning any event that involves information about You we may do so by email, telephone, or mail.</p>
